# Flags of the World Challenge
Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

**Requirements:**
  - See all countries from the API on the homepage
  - Search for a country using an input field
  - Filter countries by region
  - Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
  - Click through to the border countries on the detail page
  - Have a live demo site
  - Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (bonus)
  - Unit test your work (bonus)
  
**Restrictions** 
  - Vue is the only javascript framework accepted for this project. You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests.
  - You cannot use bootstrap or the like. SASS/SCSS is encouraged for CSS (but not required).
  
**Where to find everything**
 - In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.
 - There is a style-guide.md file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
 - The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin.
 - There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the REST Countries API and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

**Submitting your solution** 
 - Create a github repo with a link to the live site in the README file, so we can view the site and clone your project to see the workflow.
 - Email the github repo link back to the email address you recieved this challenge from.

***Have fun building!*** ðŸš€
